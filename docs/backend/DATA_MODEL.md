# Sentinel – Data Model

This document defines the core data model for Sentinel.
It describes entities, relationships, and data management rules.

All database design and access MUST conform to this document.

---

## Database Philosophy

Sentinel uses **PostgreSQL** as the system of record.

The data model is designed to be:

-   multi-tenant
-   auditable
-   append-oriented
-   scalable over time
-   friendly to analytics and rollups

PostgreSQL is authoritative.
No document-oriented database is used.

---

## Tenant Boundary

### Workspace

The Workspace is the primary tenant boundary.

All tables that store user or operational data MUST include:

-   `workspace_id`

All queries MUST be scoped by `workspace_id`.

Cross-workspace access is forbidden.

---

## Core Identity Tables

### users

Represents authenticated individuals.

Key fields:

-   id
-   name

---

### teams

Indexes:

-   workspace_id, created_at
-   repository_id, created_at

---

### findings

Represents issues identified during a Run.

Key fields:

-   id
-   run_id
-   workspace_id
-   severity
-   category
-   title
-   description
-   file_path
-   line_start
-   line_end
-   confidence
-   metadata (JSONB)
-   created_at

Findings may or may not be surfaced externally.

---

### annotations

Represents surfaced feedback in the source control platform.

Key fields:

-   id
-   finding_id
-   provider_id
-   external_id
-   type
-   created_at

---

## Policy & Configuration Tables

### policies

Represents named policy configurations.

Key fields:

-   id
-   workspace_id
-   name
-   config (JSONB)
-   version
-   created_at

---

Policy snapshots are stored directly on Runs for auditability.

---

## Usage & Billing Tables

### plans

Represents available subscription plans.

Key fields:

-   id
-   name
-   limits (JSONB)
-   features (JSONB)
-   created_at

---

### subscriptions

Represents a Workspace’s active subscription.

Key fields:

-   id
-   workspace_id
-   plan_id
-   status
-   started_at
-   ends_at
-   created_at

---

### usage_records

Represents metered usage generated by Runs.

Key fields:

-   id
-   workspace_id
-   run_id
-   type
-   quantity
-   metadata (JSONB)
-   created_at

---

### provider_keys

Represents BYOK credentials for AI providers.

Key fields:

-   id
-   workspace_id
-   provider
-   encrypted_key
-   created_at
-   updated_at

Provider keys are encrypted at rest.

---

## Analytics & Rollups

### workspace_daily_metrics

Key fields:

-   workspace_id
-   date
-   runs_count
-   findings_count
-   critical_count
-   warning_count
-   tokens_estimated

These tables are updated asynchronously.

---

## Data Integrity Rules

-   Foreign keys are enforced where appropriate
-   Deletions are soft where data must be retained
-   Runs and Findings are never updated in-place
-   Sensitive fields are encrypted

---

## Scaling & Partitioning Strategy

-   Runs and Findings may be partitioned by time
-   Indexes prioritize tenant and time-based access
-   Rollups reduce pressure on raw tables

---

## General Rules

-   JSONB is used for flexible, non-critical structure
-   Queryable fields must be normalized
-   Schema changes require migrations
-   Backfills must be idempotent
